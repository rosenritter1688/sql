DROP is used to delete a whole database or just a table.
The DROP statement destroys the objects like an existing database, table, index, or view.
A DROP statement in SQL removes a component from a relational database management system (RDBMS).
Syntax:

DROP object object_name

Examples:
DROP TABLE table_name;
--table_name: Name of the table to be deleted.

DROP DATABASE database_name;
-- database_name: Name of the database to be deleted.
